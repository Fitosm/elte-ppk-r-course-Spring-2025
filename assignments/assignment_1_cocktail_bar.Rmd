# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r load-cocktail-data, echo=TRUE}
# Read the file directly from the same folder as the .Rmd
stopifnot(file.exists("cocktail_data.tsv"))

cocktails_raw <- read.delim("cocktail_data.tsv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

glimpse(cocktails_raw)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)

clean_ingredients <- function(ingredients) {
  ingredients |>
    str_remove_all("[0-9]+/?[0-9]*\\s*(oz|cl|ml|dashes|dash|tsp|tbsp|barspoon|splash|drop|shot|parts?|% abv|%|ABV)") |>
    str_remove_all("\\b(oz|cl|ml|dashes|dash|tsp|tbsp|barspoon|bsp|splash|drop|shot|parts?|% abv|abv)\\b") |>
    str_replace_all("^\\s*[a-zA-Z]\\s+", "") |>  # NEW: remove dangling letter+space like "s "
    str_remove_all("[0-9]+\\.?[0-9]*") |>
    str_replace_all("[[:punct:]]", "") |>
    str_squish() |>
    tolower()
}

separate_html_ingredients <- function(df, col = "ingredients") {
  df |>
    mutate(
      !!sym(col) := str_replace_all(.data[[col]], "<br\\s*/?>", ";")
    ) |>
    separate_rows(!!sym(col), sep = ";") |>
    mutate(
      !!sym(col) := str_squish(.data[[col]])
    )
}

# Apply function to the dataset
cocktail_long <- cocktails_raw |>
  separate_html_ingredients(col = "ingredients") |>
  mutate(ingredient_clean = clean_ingredients(ingredients))

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
unique_ingredients <- cocktail_long |>
  distinct(ingredient_clean) |>
  arrange(ingredient_clean)
unique_ingredients
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
n_ingredients <- nrow(unique_ingredients)
n_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cocktail_long |>
  count(ingredient_clean, sort = TRUE) |>
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(desc(n))) |>
  filter(rank <= 10)

top_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_counts <- cocktail_long |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarise(ingredient_count = n()) |>
  filter(ingredient_count == max(ingredient_count))
cocktail_counts
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktail_long |>
  count(ingredient_clean) |>
  filter(n == 1)
n_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)
n_rare_ingredients
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktail_with_rare <- cocktail_long |>
  filter(ingredient_clean %in% rare_ingredients$ingredient_clean) |>
  distinct(name, ingredient_clean)
cocktail_with_rare
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
safe_cocktails <- cocktail_long |>
  filter(!ingredient_clean %in% rare_ingredients$ingredient_clean) |>
  distinct(name)
safe_cocktails
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r cheat-sheet-cleaned, results='asis'}
# Reduce to only cocktail name and cleaned ingredient
cheat_sheet <- cocktail_long |>
  select(name, ingredient_clean) |>
  distinct() |>                    # truly unique (name, ingredient) pairs
  mutate(flag = "X") |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredient_clean,
    values_from = flag,
    values_fill = list(flag = "")
  ) |>
  arrange(name)

# Display with column lines
table_html <- cheat_sheet |>
  kable("html", escape = FALSE) |>
  kable_styling(
    full_width = TRUE,
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")
  )

# Add borders to each ingredient column
for (i in 2:ncol(cheat_sheet)) {
  table_html <- table_html |> column_spec(i, border_left = TRUE)
}

table_html |> scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
